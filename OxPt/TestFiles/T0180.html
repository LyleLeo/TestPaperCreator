    <h1>Html Heading</h1>
    <p>line height is specified in terms of the size of the h1 font.  TODO Note that this doesn't really work
        in the Word rendering - puts space above, but not below.  There really are no options in WordprocessingML to
        specify line height.  I think that the only possible way that this could be implemented would be to specifically
        calculate the space before and space after.  I'm not completely sure that this could be possible.  I am pretty
        sure that this is not worth the effort.</p>
