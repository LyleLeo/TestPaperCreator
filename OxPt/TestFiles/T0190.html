    <h1>Html Heading</h1>
    <p>body text indent is 3em of 24px.  h1 inherits.  Its text indent is also the same - it inherits the computed value.
       However, it is interesting. IE9 recomputes 3em * 12px indent for h1.  Word computes 3em * 12px indent for h1, and 3em * 24px for p.
       Neither word nor IE are correct.  My conversion, and chrome are correct.</p>
